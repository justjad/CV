      <td><h1>Jad Kawas</h1>
      <p><em>Singer-Songwriter and <strong>Producer</strong>.</em>
      <p>Montreal based, Jad has always been involved in music ever since he was a child.
      His father, although not a musician per say, was an avid music listener and record collector.
      In fact, he owned his own store <b>Melodisc</b> for 25 years.
      It was almost impossible for Jad to brush off this whole world, especially with the fact that he's always sung and played the guitar.
      Nowawadays, Jad is an artist, and creates his own music.</p></td>
